Contributing guidelines
=======================

Feedback and criticism to these guidelines are welcomed, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request. However, these are best practices authored by Futurice developers, so substantial content contributions from the external community won't be necessarily included. We will review and converge on a decision to accept the contribution or not.
